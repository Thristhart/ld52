Tower Defense:
Towers are plants. They grow with kills, they wither over time? You can sell them for money based on their potency?

Shooting seeds (do we propagate?)

Seasons (Fun visuals(lots of))(Interactions with plant types. (Effectiveness, survivability, value)) Crop rotation. Enemy tendency. (Spawn frequency, or… ?)

Winter is bad?

Does each season have a specific intro effect? (Winter creating snowdrifts, Summer bringing flooding, Spring boosts growth? Autumn attracts more enemies(pretty)?)

“Those are stretch goals”
Animated seasonal overlays.
Seasonal crossfade?
Single enemy selection.
